pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Download and Prepare Datasets:

• Instructions for downloading supported datasets will be provided in the datasets directory.

• Ensure datasets are placed in the correct directories as specified.    
## Usage

### Training a Model
To train a deepfake detection model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/training_config.yaml
```
Modify the configuration file to adjust parameters like dataset paths, model architecture, training epochs, etc.

### Evaluating a Model
To evaluate a trained model, use:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path models/deep-fake-voice-detection.pth --data_path datasets/test_data
```
### Detecting Deepfakes in Audio
For real-time detection on audio files:
```bash
python detect.py --audio_file path/to/audio.wav --model_path models/deep-fake-voice-detection.pth

```
